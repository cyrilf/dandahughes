  Danda Hughes, born on Dec 16th, 1986 was brought up in Germany.

  Throughout the last years he's called many places home.

  He currently resides in Burgundy, France.


  He considers himself a 'lifestyle activist' regarding his consciously chosen low-impact lifestyle.


  Danda Hughes combines various vintage styles of music in a unique way:

  With only his voice, guitar and harmonica he manages to take you back to long forgotten times and far off places...

  He is part of the Gypsy-Swing Trio 'Swingology', the Electroswingband 'Swing Boheme Orchestra' and the India-based 'Hot Club de Arambol'.


  He frequently composes and produces in his home studio.


  ‚[Contemporary Love](https://danda-hughes.bandcamp.com/album/contemporary-love)’ was born as an idea for a concept album.

  Then Corona hit and everything changed: during a pretty dark and lonely period of last winter’s lockdown, Danda started songwriting more intensely than he ever did: about 40 Song in 2 months.

  All concepts and preconceived ideas were washed away and slowly but steadily the songs were boiled down to this EP.


  On ‚[Contemporary Love](https://danda-hughes.bandcamp.com/album/contemporary-love)‘ he reinvents his musical identity by mixing all the styles that shaped him: Beatles-inspired Pop, a hint of Gypsy Jazz and Soul a la Amy Winehouse.

  It’s hard to find a Genre to fit all songs of this EP, but ‚Retro-Soul-Pop‘ describes it pretty well.
