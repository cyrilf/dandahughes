  Danda Hughes, born on Dec 16th, 1986 was brought up in Germany.

  Throughout the last years he's called many places home.

  He currently resides in Burgundy, France.


  He considers himself a 'lifestyle activist' regarding his consciously chosen low-impact lifestyle.


  Danda Hughes combines various vintage styles of music in a unique way:

  With only his voice, guitar and harmonica he manages to take you back to long forgotten times and far off places...

  He is part of the Gypsy-Swing Trio 'Swingology', the Electroswingband 'Swing Boheme Orchestra' and the India-based 'Hot Club de Arambol'.


  He frequently composes and produces in his home studio.


  His new Solo EP '[Contemporary Love](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/danda-hughes-ep-contemporary-love#/)' is a blend of Soul, Folk, Jazz and Pop.

  It was neither planned nor intended: the Songs and styles just came out during a dark time in last winter's lockdown and manifested themselves in this EP.

  [The EP](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/danda-hughes-ep-contemporary-love#/) will be released this July (2021)
