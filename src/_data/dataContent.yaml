aboutText: "Danda Hughes, born on Dec 16th, 1986 was brought up in Germany.<br/>
Throughout the last years he's called many places home.<br/>
He currently resides in Burgundy, France.<br/><br/>
He considers himself a 'lifestyle activist' regarding his consciously chosen low-impact lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Danda Hughes combines various vintage styles of music in a unique way:<br/>
With only his voice, guitar and harmonica he manages to take you back to long forgotten times and far off places...<br/>
He is part of the Gypsy-Swing Trio 'Swingology', the Electroswingband 'Swing Boheme Orchestra' and the India-based 'Hot Club de Arambol'.<br/>
<br/>
He frequently composes and produces in his home studio.<br/>
<br/>
His new Solo EP 'Contemporary Love' is a blend of Soul, Folk, Jazz and Pop.<br/>
It was neither planned nor intended: the Songs and styles just came out during a dark time in last winter's lockdown and manifrsted themselves in this EP.<br/>
The EP will be released this July (2021)"
